# Sections Directory

The **sections** directory is designed to improve maintainability and focus when working on large pages. It serves two main purposes:

- **Reduce distractions:** By isolating individual sections into separate files, you can work on one part of a page without being distracted by unrelated code.
- **Prevent oversized files:** Splitting content ensures that no single file becomes too long or difficult to navigate & modify.
